# Library Management System

A console-based library management system built in Java to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Description

This project is a fully functional library management system that allows users to manage a collection of books through an interactive menu-driven interface. The system handles book inventory, borrowing, returning, and provides analytics on library usage.

## Features

- **Search Books by Category**: Find all books in a specific category (Fiction, Science, History, Non-Fiction)
- **Borrow Books**: Check out available copies with automatic inventory updates
- **Return Books**: Return borrowed books with validation
- **Calculate Rental Cost**: Compute total rental fees based on duration and quantity
- **Most Popular Book**: Identify the most borrowed book based on availability ratio
- **Library Statistics**: View total inventory, available copies, and pricing information

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Scanner for user input
- Menu-driven architecture

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Classes and Objects**: LibraryBook class with multiple instances
- **Encapsulation**: Book properties with controlled access through methods
- **Methods**: borrowBook(), returnBook(), calculateRentalCost(), display()
- **Constructors**: Initialize book objects with all required data
- **Boolean Return Values**: For validation and success/failure handling
